Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
I felt that this episode was encouraging the exploration of space.
It was designed to cause curiosity about the unknown.
I feel that exploration of space is interesting, but so should the oceans.
It really puts things into perspective, that our struggles mean little.
What does this say about the purpose of humans?
Does this disprove the Bible?

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
It really is amazing how Newton's laws of gravity is used to predict planetary 
motion.
I thought it was impressive how Newton was able to derive a mathematical 
equation for gravity.
This video, especially the part about Newton, was expressful of the importance
of collaboration, as well as communication.
Hooke got what was coming to him, plagiarism never pays off.
